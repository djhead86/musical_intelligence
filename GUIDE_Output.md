🎧 How to Understand the Analysis Outputs

This tool analyzes musical structure, not taste, genre, or “quality.”
It does not tell you:
  if a song is good or bad
  if it will be popular
  if it follows theory rules

It does help you see:
  how energy moves through a song
  where repetition happens (intentionally or not)
  where new ideas actually appear
  how sections relate to each other

Think of this like a CT scan for music.

How to Read the Results (Critical Rule)
  Do not look at everything at once.
  Always read the outputs in this order:
    Waveform + Energy
    Spectral Features
    Novelty Curve
    Repetition / Fatigue Heatmap
    Section Similarity Matrix
    Key + Chord Timeline

Edit Suggestions

Each plot answers one question.
If you skip ahead, the results will feel confusing or misleading.

1️⃣ Waveform + Energy / Onset
What this shows

Waveform: raw loudness over time

RMS Energy: perceived intensity

Onset Strength: rhythmic activity and impact

What to ask

Does the song rely on loudness to create structure?

Are there clear “breathing points”?

Is energy flat, ramping, or pulsing?

How to interpret

Flat RMS ≠ boring

Rising RMS ≠ good

Sudden drops often mean intentional resets

This plot answers:

How does the song spend its energy?

2️⃣ Spectral Features (Brightness / Texture)
What this shows

Centroid → brightness

Bandwidth → density

Rolloff → high-frequency content

What to ask

Do sections sound different, or just feel different?

Are changes gradual or sudden?

Does texture evolve or stay constant?

How to interpret

Stable spectrum = cohesion

Step changes = section boundaries

Too much sameness may reduce contrast

This plot answers:

Is the song changing its sound, or just repeating it?

3️⃣ Novelty Curve (Section Change Proxy)
What this shows

A measure of new musical information over time.

High novelty:

new rhythms

new layers

transitions

breakdowns

Low novelty:

repetition

sustained grooves

hypnotic sections

What to ask

Where are new ideas introduced?

How long do ideas stay before changing?

Are there long flat stretches?

How to interpret

Low novelty ≠ bad

High novelty ≠ exciting

Different genres want different novelty profiles.

This plot answers:

Where does new information actually enter the song?

4️⃣ Repetition / Fatigue Heatmap
What this shows

How similar every moment of the song is to every other moment.

Bright blocks = high similarity

Dark regions = contrast

Diagonal blocks = repeated sections

What to ask

Am I repeating intentionally?

Do repeated sections escalate or stay static?

Is repetition creating tension or stagnation?

How to interpret

Repetition can hypnotize or exhaust

Uniform blocks may indicate missed escalation

Symmetry usually means structure

This plot answers:

Am I repeating with purpose or by habit?

5️⃣ Section Similarity Matrix
What this shows

How similar detected sections are to each other.

Think of this as a zoomed-out version of the heatmap.

What to ask

How many real sections does this song have?

Which sections are essentially the same?

Could two sections be combined?

How to interpret

Many near-identical sections → possible tightening

Clear clusters → strong structure

Few contrasts → cohesive but potentially flat

This plot answers:

How many distinct sections does the song actually contain?

6️⃣ Key + Chord Timeline
What this shows

An estimate of tonal center and chord changes.

Very important

This plot is least reliable for:

distorted guitars

modal music

drone-based music

groove-driven tracks

What to ask

Is harmony a primary driver of this song?

Are there stable tonal plateaus?

How to interpret

Low confidence = harmony is not dominant

Rapid changes may reflect texture, not chords

This plot answers:

Is harmony doing the structural work here?

7️⃣ Edit Suggestions
What this shows

Highlighted zones where:

novelty drops unusually low

repetition is sustained without escalation

How to use this

These are not instructions.

They are:

review points

questions, not commands

Ask:

Does this section earn its length?

Is repetition intentional here?

Would one small change improve contrast?

This plot answers:

Where might a listener lose attention?

How to Use This Tool Correctly
Good uses

Compare versions of the same song

Study reference tracks

Find overlong sections

Diagnose arrangement issues

Understand genre structure

Bad uses

Chasing novelty everywhere

Removing repetition blindly

Treating plots as rules

Letting graphs override musical instinct

Final Principle

This tool does not tell you what to change.

It shows you where you have choice.

If the data disagrees with your ears:

Trust your ears

But ask why the data reacted that way

That question is where improvement lives.
